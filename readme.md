# Blood 
Step 1: Define the Roles

The key is to divide the work by architecture layer. This allows each person to become a specialist in their domain while still collaborating on features.
●	Person A: Backend & Database Architect
○	Focus: The "engine" of the application.
○	Responsibilities: Building the server-side application with NestJS, designing the MongoDB database schemas with Mongoose, creating all the REST API endpoints, and implementing security (authentication, authorization, RBAC).
○	Core Technologies: NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT (for auth).
●	Person B: Frontend & UI/UX Specialist
○	Focus: The "face" of the application.
○	Responsibilities: Building the user-facing dashboards for both hospitals and donors using Next.js. Responsible for all UI components, state management, user experience, and making the application intuitive and easy to use.
○	Core Technologies: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Material-UI (or Ant Design), Redux/Zustand.
●	Person C: Real-Time & Services Integrator
○	Focus: The "connective tissue" of the application.
○	Responsibilities: Implementing the real-time layer with Socket.IO for live dashboard updates. Integrating all third-party services for notifications (Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for Email, FCM for Push) and geolocation (Google Maps API).
○	Core Technologies: Socket.IO, Twilio API, SendGrid API, Firebase Admin SDK, Google Maps Platform.
This structure allows all three of you to work on a single feature (like "Raising an Alert") simultaneously from different angles.

Step 3: Phased Project Roadmap & Task Division

This roadmap breaks the project into manageable chunks with clear deliverables and responsibilities.

Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Weeks 1-2)

Goal: Get the project structure and basic authentication working.
●	Person A (Backend):
○	Set up NestJS project.
○	Define initial Mongoose schemas for User, Donor, Hospital.
○	Implement JWT-based registration and login API endpoints.
○	Implement basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) middleware.
●	Person B (Frontend):
○	Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and a UI library.
○	Create the main layout, navigation, and routing structure.
○	Build the Login and Registration pages.
○	Integrate the login/registration forms with the backend APIs.
●	Person C (Services):
○	Create accounts for Twilio, SendGrid, and Firebase.
○	Write simple wrapper services/modules for sending a test SMS and email.
○	Set up a basic Socket.IO server instance within the NestJS app.

Phase 2: Core MVP - Hospital & Alert Flow (Weeks 3-5)

Goal: A hospital can log in, raise an alert, and see it on their dashboard.
●	Person A (Backend):
○	Build the /alerts API endpoints (create, get).
○	Implement the core donor matching logic (querying MongoDB by blood type and geolocation).
○	Build the /hospitals endpoints for profile and inventory management.
●	Person B (Frontend):
○	Build the Hospital Dashboard.
○	Create the "Raise Alert" form.
○	Create the "Live Alerts" feed component that will display active alerts.
○	Build the "Inventory Management" UI.
●	Person C (Services):
○	Integrate the donor matching logic with Twilio/SendGrid to notify matched donors when an alert is created.
○	Connect the "Live Alerts" feed on the frontend to the backend using Socket.IO to show new alerts in real-time.

Phase 3: Engagement Layer - Donor Dashboard & Rewards (Weeks 6-8)

Goal: Donors can manage their profile, see their impact, and be rewarded.
●	Person A (Backend):
○	Build the /donors endpoints for profile management.
○	Build the backend logic for the rewards system (awarding points for donations).
○	Create schemas and endpoints for DonationHistory.
●	Person B (Frontend):
○	Build the complete Donor Dashboard.
○	Create the "My Profile," "Donation History," and "Rewards" sections.
○	Visualize the points, badges, and reward tiers.
●	Person C (Services):
○	Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send web push notifications for rewards and alerts.
○	Integrate Google Maps API on the frontend to display camp locations or donor heatmaps.

Phase 4: Proactive Layer - Camp Management (Weeks 9-10)

Goal: Hospitals can organize and manage blood donation camps.
●	Person A (Backend):
○	Build all API endpoints for the CampsModule (create, manage, register attendees).
●	Person B (Frontend):
○	Build the UI for hospitals to create and manage camps.
○	Create a public-facing page for donors to view and register for upcoming camps.
●	Person C (Services):
○	Integrate the notification services to send camp invitations to targeted donors via SMS/Email.

Phase 5: Polish & Deployment (Weeks 11-12)

Goal: Test, containerize, and deploy the application.
●	Team Effort:
○	Write unit and end-to-end tests.
○	Create Dockerfiles for the backend and frontend (Person A & B).
○	Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment (Person C).
○	Deploy to a cloud provider like AWS or Google Cloud.

Step 4: Collaboration & Workflow

●	Daily Stand-ups: A quick 15-minute call every morning. Each person answers: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Am I blocked by anything?
●	Code Management: Use GitHub Flow. Create a new branch for every new task (e.g., feature/login-api). When done, open a Pull Request (PR). At least one other team member must review the code before it's merged into the main branch. This maintains code quality.
●	Task Management: Use a simple Trello or Asana board with columns like Backlog, To Do, In Progress, In Review, and Done. This makes the entire project status visible at a glance.
●	API Contracts: Before Person A builds an API and Person B consumes it, agree on the exact structure of the request and response (the "contract"). Post this in your shared Slack/Discord channel so there's no confusion.
